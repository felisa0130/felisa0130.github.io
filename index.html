        <p>
        I'm a dynamic marketing professional with a bachelor's degree in marketing from the University of South Florida. 
        Currently, I am enrolled in a Web & UX design program at Wake Tech Community College, further expanding my skill set.
        Outside of work, I indulge my interests in yoga, exercise, design, and exploring museums.
